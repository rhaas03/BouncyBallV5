# BouncyBallV5
5th Version of my Java BouncyBall game. Modeled off iOS and Android mobile game

This is the 5th Version of my BouncyBall game, a personal project that I started in mid-March of 2016. I started the project
to see if I could create a Java game modeled off of a mobile game. Eventually I started using the project to expand my knowledge
of Java and to not fall out of practice with the language. I only started programming last year, and am very proud of the
progress I've made with this project and Java.
